ros-kinetic-cob-hand-bridge (0.6.1-0xenial) xenial; urgency=high

  * fix install tags
  * move launch files to bringup
  * start init server after status topic is connected
  * speed-up line parsing
  * fixed offset calculation bug
  * stop timer on preemption
  * improved deadline timer
  * fixed typo in JointValues.msg
  * resend while moving
  * set nominal current as default
  * renamed g_motors_stopped to to g_motion_stopped
  * resend only if control was stopped
  * set default velocity (unused, but must be in valid range)
  * move command string format was wrong, updated to signed
  * pass currents to SDHx
  * read currents from trajectory
  * parse default currents
  * non-positive resend_timer disables it
  * stop resending on error
  * use deadline timer instead of resend timer
  * properly handle goal if already at target
  * added missing dependency
  * Fix for #6 <https://github.com/ipa320/cob_hand/issues/6>, added dependency to self
  * deep-copy port string
  * require movement to start
  * migrated to goalCB
  * increased stopped velocity
  * support trajectories with missing header stamp
  * proper conversions
  * do not test for tolerances size (outdated code)
  * catch not connected error in init
  * first status detected was buggy
  * finger ready  logic was inverted
  * added trajectory interface
  * wait for init_finger service
  * enable recover on non-zero RC
  * Use global namespaces to make remap work
  * Do not check required interfase per default
    rosserial checks FQN, does not work with component namespaces
  * report error on non-zero SDHx return code
  * added diagnostics
  * c&p bug
  * device port was missing the leading slash
  * resize position vector before filling it
  * advertise recover service
  * updated mismatched MD5 sums
  * added first version of node
  * implemented recover service
  * actually read velocity and current from SDHx
  * switched to signed current entry
  * improved line parsing
  * Keep existing PWM setting if value is zero
  * Create README.md
  * PWM just works for first bank
  * added launch file
  * refactored for PWM feature
  * added support for bank1
  * removed sdhx.cpp from CMake config
  * SDHx implementation
  * first test app with GPIO
